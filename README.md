# Cryptobot token sniper

Multiplatform crypto bot for sniping and frontrunning on BSC and Ether

## Website

The website is fully working and is under active development: https://sniper-native.web.app/

## Fee

During development the website is free of use, then in will take 10% from the single snipe if and only if the snipe is profitable and > 0.01 BNB (you will be alerted and you will need to accept the terms and conditions after the beta testing).

Guys that will contribute with usefull issues will have free life access to sniper tool.

## Security

The only APIs on the website are used for login/logout or to save configurations based on your will.

All sniper logic and code is published in the website and the source code is available with Chrome Developer Tools, but it's obfuscated to avoid to be stolen. If you are an expert you can decode the source code and check that the website is secure.

In any case use a new wallet and Do Your Own Research on the coin that you want to snipe!
