# cryptobot
Multiplatform crypto bot for sniping and frontrunning on BSC and Ether

The website is fully working and is under development: https://sniper-native.web.app/

The only APIs on the website are used for login/logout or to save configurations based on your will.

All sniper logic and code is published in the website and the source code is available with Chrome Developer Tools, but it's obfuscated so it cannot be stolen. If you are an expert you can decode the source code and check that the website is secure.

In any case use a new wallet and Do Your Own Research on the coin that you want to snipe!

For any feature request or issue open an issue on this repo.
