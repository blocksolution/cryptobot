# cryptobot
Multiplatform crypto bot for sniping and frontrunning on BSC and Ether

The website is fully working and is under development: https://sniper-native.web.app/

IMPORTANT: after you sign up, send an email to bscsniperbot@gmail.com to require the access to the website during development.

During development the website is free of use, then in will take 10% from the single snipe if and only if the snipe is profitable and > 0.01 BNB. 

The only APIs on the website are used for login/logout or to save configurations based on your will.

All sniper logic and code is published in the website and the source code is available with Chrome Developer Tools, but it's obfuscated so it cannot be stolen. If you are an expert you can decode the source code and check that the website is secure.

In any case use a new wallet and Do Your Own Research on the coin that you want to snipe!

Android and iOS version coming soon!

For any feature request or issue open an issue on this repo.
